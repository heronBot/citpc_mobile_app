LOGIC FOR CITPC CONNECTOR

However, the funcanality and the scraping technique used is shown here)

# the login_url is the url of the page, that asks us to input our username and password
# you may see it on the browsers address input box in the top when trying to login via broswer
# you can use functions like input() to handle the input of username and password
# in the app, the UI layout and textfields were used to take the input

# importing all the modules we need
import requests
import time

# in the original app, threading was also used and 'kivy' libraries were also used which are not used here 
# the 'time' module is optional which will be shown later


# the payload containts the parameters that are used by the server of CIT, the first is mode
# which we reversed engineered to know was 191 for logging in, 'a' refers to the time in kiloseconds (10^3 * time.time())
# you can enter any time in 'a', so time.time() may be ommited with any number so importing of time module is optional
# similarly the producttype also maybe virtually anything or empty

# the headers used below are ,as an outside code for us to pretend like browsers, not using this may also work

# of a browser, the headers simulate a web browser
